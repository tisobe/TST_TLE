    t. isobe (tisobe@cfa.harvard.edu)

Modified scripts to run on linux. 

get_tle.pl
----------
    copy data and run spacetrack, get_tle2.pl, and cocoxmm

    input   - http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/science.txt

    output  -   cxo.tle2        --- input for spacetrack    --- orbit related parameters
                xmm.tle2        --- input for spacetrack
                cxo.spctrk      --- input for get_tle2.pl   --- position/velocity list
                xmm.spctrk      --- input for get_tle2.pl
                cxo.j2000                                   --- j2000 ECI and gsm coordinates
                xmm.j2000


spacetrack
-----------
    fortran code to trak position and velocity of Earth orbiting objects. 
    see detail description: spacetrk.pdf

        f77 spacetrack.f -o spacetrack

        Usage: 
        ./spacetrack < xmm.tle2 > xmm.spctrk

        Sample inputs are in test.dat, which are the test cases
        shown in the documentation in spacetrk.pdf
        Only the models SGP, SGP4, SGP8 are working.
        The models SDP4 and SDP8 do not work. I don't know why yet.
        Also the results from SGP, SGP4 and SGP8 only agree with
        the documented expected results to about 6 or 7 sig digits.
        But since the documented results are from FORTRAN on an
        old computer (pre-IEEE floating point?), and it's single
        precision code.


        The time conversion routines used in spacetrack.f can be
        checked using the following perl one-liner:
        perl -e '($s,$m,$h,$y,$d) = (gmtime(1086372000))[0,1,2,5,7]; $y += 1900; print "$y $d $h $m $s\n"'


get_tle2.pl
-----------
    convert TLE ephemeris files to J2000 ECI and GSM coordinates

    fortran code needed: wcs/wcstools-3.9.1/bin/skycoor
        wcstools-3.9.1 was updated on Feb 6, 2015 (most recent version  as of mid Feb 2015)
        see for more details at: http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/

    input   -- format of cxo.spctrk

    output  -- format of cxo.j2000

cocoxmm
-------
    Convert XMM and CXO ECI linear coords to GSE, GSM coords

    fortran code
        f77 cocoxmm.f /data/mta/Script/Ephem/Scripts/geopack/geopack.f \
        /data/mta/Script/Ephem/Scripts/geopack/supple.f -o cocoxm

    input  --   xmm.j2000
                cxo.j2000

    output --   xmm.spctrk      (XMM state vectors in ECI at epoch of TLE date)
                xmm.j2000       (XMM position in J2000 ECI coords)
                xmm.gsme        (XMM position in GSM and GSE coords)
                xmm.gsme_in_Re  (XMM position in GSM coords in units of Re, 
                                  suitable for use with call to CRMFLX).
                ditto for cxo.*
